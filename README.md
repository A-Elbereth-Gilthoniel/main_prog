# News Site
This program is the outer shell of a news site. It is written in JavaScript "React".
Let's get this code up and running in the terminal.

### `npm start`

Then, we go to the page http://localhost:3000/posts/

![site](https://github.com/A-Elbereth-Gilthoniel/images/blob/main/site.png)


There is a sorting table at the top of the page, which allows users to sort the news articles by name or date.

By clicking on the name of the post, we go to its page.
